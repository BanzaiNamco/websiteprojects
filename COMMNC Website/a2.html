		<p> Epic Games released a pet dog named Gunner to the Fortnite shop earlier today that players could purchase for 1000 V-bucks and then carry around with them on their backs. But now its gone, because it was a little too similar or virtually identical to a prior dog-in-a-backpack named Bonesy who was included in a previous Battle Pass.  </p>
		<p> Gunner and Bonesy are technically different, yes, but not meaningfully because Gunner's bandanna has a logo on it, his fur is very slightly more yellow, and his eyes are a bit more crossed. They're similar enough that it would be tricky to tell which is which when they're not being compared side by side, especially since Bonesy is already available in multiple colors. The price tag was also an issue. Full battle passes are bought at 950 V-Bucks (about $10), less than the cost of Gunner. </p>

		<p> Epic apologized for releasing Gunner on the Fortnite store and said that everyone who purchased the pet will be given a full refund, plus an additional 200 V-Bucks, within the next few days. People who refund Gunner ahead of that will get the 200 bonus V-Bucks and a replacement Refund Token "that can be put towards any eligible items that were purchased within the past 30 days.</p>
