		<h1>  New Nintendo Switch Model Now Available at US Online Retailers  </h1>

		<p> Both Amazon and Best Buy are now selling the new and improved Nintendo Switch model, with the latter currently advertising $25 extra trade-in credit for those looking to purchase  the updated console. </p>
		<p> The feature of the new improved Switch model is its longer battery life. Nintendo's official  estimate puts the new model's battery life between 4.5 and 9 hours, depending on the game you're playing.  This is an improvement over the original Switch, which lasted for between 2.5 and 6.5 hours and  3 to 7 hours offered by the upcoming Switch Lite.</p>
		<p> Early tests were run by famous YouTube gaming channels and they showed the new Switch lasting for  five hours and 36 minutes while playing launch title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and the recently  released Fire Emblem: Three Houses running for two hours in portable mode, with 60% of the battery life still remaining. </p>

		<p> Kevin Kenson, a YouTube creator, had previously confirmed that the new Switch model also has an updated screen model number,  which would explain why his tests revealed that the screen is both brighter and closer to true white balance in tone. This also fitS Sharp's announcement that its IGZO display would be used by Nintendo's consoles in the future. </p>
`		<p> But wait. There's more. the updated Switch model's Tegra X1 processor also runs cooler, which in turn keeps your Switch  from heating up as much. </p>
		<p> If you have one of the older Switch models and don't want to purchase the new one from either Amazon or Best Buy, GameStop stores  are currently running an offer where you can trade in the launch model for $225, up from the usual $200, as part of a limited-time deal.  This brings the $300 Switch revision to $75, netting you a tasty saving. This offer is valid until September 15 only. </p>
		<p> If you'd rather trade in your old launch model for the upcoming Switch Lite, you can use your $225 trade credit towards a pre-order  for that instead. The Switch Lite costs $200 and releases on September 20, five days after this trade-in promotion ends so bear with living without your precious switch for a few days. </p>
