	<center><h1>IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE: VIRTUAL REALITY </h1></center>
	<p>Virtual Reality is all the rage at the moment. Whether it be in media, or in the gaming industry, VR has played an important role in the world’s development.
	<p>Virtual Reality in gaming tends to mean the complete immersion of someone into an experience like a game or real-world simulation. 
	<p>The first ever VR device was released way back in 1989. Nintendo released their Powerglove for NES. However, it was said to be scrapped due to its hard to use controls. 
	 

	<p>In 1990, Virtual Society developed a series of arcade games via arcade machines  and they were called Virtuality. These were VR pods where gamers could play in a 3D gaming world. They consisted of a set of VR goggles that allowed players to play games with immersive stereoscopic 3D visuals and in real-time. Some machines were even networked together to enable multiplayer gaming experiences.</P>

	<p>Sega jumped on the bandwagon in 1993 with the reveal of their prototype, their Sega VR headset for the mighty Sega Genesis. This was a wrap-around headset that included head tracking, stereo sound and had LCD screens in its visor. </P>

	<p>Then entered the most famous VR gaming system of the 1990's - The Nintendo Virtual Boy. This was a cumbersome 3D gaming console that was advertised as the first portable console with true 3D graphics. </p>

	<p>The Virtual Boy had so many issues including its lack of color graphics (games were only in red or black), lack of software support and it was uncomfortable to use.</P>

	<p>The Virtual Boy's sales failed to meet expectations for Nintendo and they discontinued its production in 1996.</p>

	<p>Other affordable home VR headsets were released as well such as the I-Glasses and the VFX1 Headgear. 
	VR in the gaming industry back then failed. The reasons are because the equipment used were rubbish, the graphics of the games were terrible and it was overall just simply bad to use. 
	In 2010, Palmer Luckey - 18 year old entrepreneur, created the first prototype of the Oculus Rift headset. It had a 90-degree field of vision, which had never been seen before that time and relied on a computer's power to deliver the images. This development boosted and refreshed interest in VR.</P>
	 
	<p>The following year, Apple released their iPhone ‘Virtual Reality’ viewer and interactive games can be played using it.</P>
	<p>The early 2010s were the rise of VR. Many companies started to release their own controllers, each one being used especially in gaming. Google released Cardboard, Samsung’s Gear VR was launched and by mid 2010s, hundreds of companies have released their own versions of gears but they were usually button-operated. But HTC released its HTC VIVE SteamVR headset. This was the first commercial release of a headset with sensor-based tracking which allowed users to move freely in a space. Some of the most popular games then played using HTC’s headset includes Fallout 4, SuperHot and others. Sony even released theri PlayStation VR system for PS4 and it was one of the biggest hits ever.</p> 
	<p>Virtual reality has significantly progressed and is now being used in a variety of fields. That is from providing immersive gaming experiences, to teaching new skills and such. VR has many applications and with the rise in smartphone technology, VR will be even more accessible, especially in the gaming industry since this is where the demand of VR is the highest.

	<center><h1>IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE: AUGMENTED REALITY </h1></center>
	<p>What is Augmented Reality?</p>
	<p>Augmented reality may be a new technology to some. However, it has been around since the 20th century. It is the blending of interactive digital elements into our real world environment. In the gaming industry, AR uses the existing environment and creates a playing field within it. AR games are typically played on devices like smartphones, tablets and other portable gaming systems.</p>
	<p>Augmented Reality infiltrated the gaming industry back in 2000. Bruce Thomas from Wearable Computer Lab demonstrated the very first outdoor mobile augmented reality video game. The game was called ARQuake and it allows the players to walk around without the use of a joystick or a controller and only needed a computer backpack and gyroscopes. </p>
	<p>After that, augmented reality was applied to other applications as well. The Nintendo 3DS which was introduced in 2011, came with AR Cards that trigger integrated AR games. Though the most popularized game was Pokémon Go which was developed and published by Niantic back in 2016.</p> 
	<p>Snapchat has even created its own AR games that are built right into the app. The use of facial gestures controls all your movements in each game.</p>
	<p>Augmented reality is a technology that has been incorporated into many different aspects of our lives. But I believe that AR has more potential than it is given credit for.</p> 
	<p>AR can transform our lives for the better, not only in the gaming industry. The possibilites of AR technology are limitless.  The reality is, as augmented, as it may be, the advances in technology are heading in the right direction and will revolutionize the way we live for the better. Afterall, augmented reality could lead to industrial revolution and the breakthrough of Pokemon Go can prove that.</p>

	<center><h1>AI DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT</h1></center>
	<p>Artificial Intelligence research has been used in many fields. In the gaming industry, game AI began to emerge not long after the birth of video games and it has gained huge progress since then. These days, Game AI has become an unavoidable component and is playing a significant role in raising the quality of games.</p>
	<p>Artificial Intelligence has been integrated with gameplay since its inception, developing over the years to incorporate more complex and challenging scenarios. It’s mainly used to imitate humanlike characteristics, enhance gameplay and improve user experience. Game AI is mainly associated with the development of behaviors in non-player characters (NPC’s) although not exclusively personified. It allows NPC pathfinding from A to B, traversing various terrain and navigation around the virtual world to appropriately avoid collision with enemies or find allies.</p>
	<p>Arcade games are one of the earliest instances of commercial gaming using stored patterns to direct enemy movement. The later inclusion of microprocessors allowed for more random movement patterns. One of the first examples of this in popular gaming is in iconic fixed-shooter game Space Invaders in 1978. Arcade games used early AI in the form of stored patterns, simulating random movements of the aliens that were actually pre-programmed into the game. This AI successfully kept players hooked and slotting coins into the machines!</p>
	<p>Pac-Man that was launched back in 1980 also hit the arcades bringing AI to a complex maze based game. But, forget about the hungry yellow blob – it’s all about the ghosts! This innovative AI programming allowed these colorful creatures to exhibit different personality traits, deceiving players into thinking they’re playing against 4 individual entities.</p>
	<p>Fast forward a couple of decades to when real-life simulation game The Sims in 2000s, let you assume the role of an all-powerful being from the comfort of your armchair. By using need-based formulas, different objects affected the character’s behaviors and relationships. Characteristics defined by the player at the start of the game impacted The Sims character’s choices. Outcomes are based on variables like coaching style or abilities of managers and players.
	<p>Combat games have garnered much attention for AI development as well. Finite State Machines are used in development to indicate the flow of action of AI in-game in games like Tekken and Mortal Kombat Series.</p>
	<p>Insanely successful GTA5 pushed open the world to the next level with the most lifelike characters seen in gaming. It was set in a simulation of the real world. It’s come a long way from the bird's-eye view shots of the original release way back then.</p>
	<p>Data Mining has also helped developers automate difficulty levels to create interactive and challenging worlds. The AI increases as the gamer engages in more play, feeding the system with more data.</p>
	 
	<p>The past years have witnessed the evolution of game AI. However it is still under development. The way that game AI performs is still often not satisfying, according to consumers. Take RTS games for example: the reason why it has become successful is more due to the exciting competition between real human players. None of the most popular games these days is attractive because of the excellent job that has been done on AI performance. Game AI still has a long way to go. With the development of computer industry, game AI would enjoy more space to show its possibility. With more and more scientific research on game AI, we could expect a promising game AI in the near future. Afterall, the gaming industry will continue to evolve rapidly like it always has, with AI and big data leading it into new unchartered territories.</p>

	<center><h1>EDGE COMPUTING, CLOUD TO THE EDGE</h1></center>
	<p>Edge computing has been around since the 1990s but with the rise of the internet of things (IoT), the technology is finally taking hold.</p>
	<p>Edge Computing or Cloud to The Edge is commonly applied or used in data related things. It collects data and it sends the data to a central data center or cloud for processing.</p>
	<p>However, In 2000, G-cluster demonstrated cloud gaming technology at E3. The original offering was cloud gaming service over Wi-Fi to handheld devices. Video game developer Crytek began the research on a cloud gaming system in 2005. But they halted development in 2007 to wait until the infrastructure and cable Internet providers were able and willing and sd </p>
	<p>OnLive, a cloud game streaming service,  was officially launched in 2010, and its game service began in with the sale of its own microconsole. Cloud gaming looked to become the future of video gaming back then. But on April 2, 2015, it was announced that Sony acquired OnLive's patents, and OnLive closed down for good. </p>
	<p>Many other cloud gaming services were launched. In November 2010, SFR launched a commercial cloud gaming service on IPTV in France, powered by G-cluster technology. And the following year, Orange France unveiled its gaming service on IPTV based on G-cluster technology.</p>
	<p>Gaikai, another cloud gaming service was launched internationally back in 2011 with games like Dead Space 2, The Sims 3, Spore, and Mass Effect 2. But Sony acquired Gaikai on 2012 and introduced PlayStation Now in 2014. </p>
	 
	<p>One of the best cloud game streaming services ever launched is GeForce Now. GeForce Now. It is offered by Nvidia and was launched on 2015. It is cloud-based and allows all users to play games directly from the web, with its servers that offer content, including 3D games that encode frames immediately, sending the data to wire/wireless Internet connection accordingly.
	The Nvidia GRID includes both graphics processing and video encoding into a single device which is able to decrease the input to display latency of cloud based video game streaming.This is important due to the impact that latency will have between what the user does and when the action shows on their screen.
	Next up was Google Stadia. Google unveiled Project Stream on October 1, 2018. From October 5, 2018 to January 15, 2019 a limited number of US participants could play Assassin's Creed Odyssey through Google Chrome. The project was formally announced at the 2019 Game Developers Conference Stadia. Stadia supports gameplay at 4K at 60 fps and future plans for scaling to 8K at 120 fps.</p>
	 
	<p>Microsoft also unveiled Project xCloud on 2018, which aims to incorporate Microsoft Azure cloud services into cloud gaming. As of May 24, 2019, Microsoft's Corporate Vice President, Kareem Choudry, announced that Project xCloud could already stream 3,500 Xbox titles.</p>
	 
	<p>Edge computing promises better gaming experiences by lowering latency and improving accessibility at a more affordable cost to gamers. When workloads run at the edge of the network, data only needs to travel the minimum necessary distance, reducing associated lag time and enabling more interactive and immersive in-game experiences. Furthermore, edge computing is paving the way for more subscription-based models that could ultimately put some money back in gamers’ pockets by reducing the need for game and hardware investments. Edge computing also boosts the opportunity to serve multiplayer gaming. A key advantage to edge computing for VR and AR experiences is the ability to reduce dizziness associated with low latency and slow frame refresh rates.</p>

	<center><h1>DIGITAL TWINS</h1></center>
	<p>Digital Twins are virtual replicas of both potential and actual physical assets, processes, people, devices, places and such. Digital Twins can be thought of as a connector between our physical world and the world of digital technology. The digital twin technology was usually implemented in fields of research that aren’t physically accessible.</p>
	<p>In 2013, DTS developed and created a video game for safety training in the Oil and Gas industry. The game used and followed the concept of the Digital Twin and it actually helped a lot of workers learn a lot.</p>
	<p>Research has stated that once this technology is applied in the gaming industry, there would be efficient visualization, graphics will be more realistic, it is real-time rendering and it can be played in multiplayer. There isn’t much about Digital Twins in the field of gaming industry yet. However, the success of the minor game proves the great potential of Digital Twins in the gaming industry</p>

	<center><h1>PRIVACY AND ETHICS</h1></center>
	<p>Games in the past used to be really unprotected. Hacking of accounts, fraud, failure of in-game purchases and even stealing.But now, accounts are heavily protected with passwords, backups to retrieve your accounts. Policies are now heavier and the penalties for breaking these policies are harsher.</p>
	</br>

	<center><h1>INTERNET OF THINGS</h1></center>
	<p>The IoT makes gaming more mobile.</p>
	<p>The Internet of Things promises to transform the way we live by connecting sensors, appliances, and other electronics to each other through local networks and the Internet at large. It’s a way for individuals, businesses, and governments to automatically and seamlessly share and collect data on an unprecedented scale. For gaming operators, it’s an opportunity to engage with players through a promising and highly-rewarding channel.</p>
	<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is an ongoing trend where more and more electronic devices – sensors, monitors, cameras, etc. – are connected to each other through local and global networks. </p>
	<p>Like the Internet of Things, the online gaming industry has seen incredible year-over-year growth with the proliferation of high speed Internet and mobile computing. Mobile casinos in particular have seen explosive growth with the increasing popularity of smartphones and tablets. Free-to-play games, while different from traditional online gaming platforms, are among today’s highest grossing games on Apple’s App Store. These games differ in their use of in-app purchases and virtual currencies to drive player engagement and build revenue.</p>
	<p>Game operators already rely on analytics to track player involvement and keep players interested. Loyalty programs have historically managed this by rewarding players and provide incentives for continuing to play, while still allowing the operator to maximize returns. This requires a lot of decision making and data processing: to accomplish this, physical casinos rely heavily on cameras, sensors, and feedback from dealers to provide the data needed to make these decisions. With the IoT and online gaming, much of this process can be automated.</p>
	<p>The IoT has the potential to revolutionize online gaming in one of two ways: by bridging the physical gap between the platform and the player, and by integrating online platforms with physical casinos.</p>
	<p>The IoT is spearheaded in part by the increased use of mobile devices. Smartphones and tablets contain an array of sensors – cameras, accelerometers, touch and pressure sensors, and even heart rate monitors – that mobile apps can tap into to collect and report data about the user’s experience. We’re seeing a new market appear in fitness bands and smartwatches, which communicate with mobile devices to display notifications, track health and activity, and even manage calls and SMS messages right from the user’s wrist.</p>
	<p>What does this have to do with online gaming? By tracking and analyzing the right data sets, online gaming platforms can learn over time how customers interact with and respond to online games. Much like how casinos can an analyze player reactions through facial expressions, speech, and nonverbal cues, mobile devices provide a variety of ways to measure player satisfaction during the course of a game.</p>
	<p>The trick with mobile gaming platforms is that they have to balance data collection with player privacy. When a player walks into a casino, there’s a mutual understanding that the player can be monitored over the course of their stay there. With the IoT, the play area shifts from the casino’s property to the player’s property, and the relationship becomes more nuanced. For instance, mobile apps require explicit acceptance from the user before they can even be installed on the device. Mobile data collection is useful, but it has to be done in a way that respects the user’s privacy, or otherwise makes the agreement perfectly apparent.</p>
