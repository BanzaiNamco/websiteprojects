		<h1 style="text-decoration:none; color: white">  New Nintendo Switch Model Now Available at US Online Retailers  </h1>
		<p style = "text-decoration: none; color: white"> Both Amazon and Best Buy are now selling the new and improved Nintendo Switch model, </br> with the latter currently advertising $25 extra trade-in credit for those looking to purchase </br> the updated console. </p>
		<p style = "text-decoration: none; color: white"> The feature of the new improved Switch model is its longer battery life. Nintendo's official </br> estimate puts the new model's battery life between 4.5 and 9 hours, depending on the game you're playing. </br> This is an improvement over the original Switch, which lasted for between 2.5 and 6.5 hours and </br> 3 to 7 hours offered by the upcoming Switch Lite.</p>
		<p style = "text-decoration: none; color: white"> Early tests were run by famous YouTube gaming channels and they showed the new Switch lasting for </br> five hours and 36 minutes while playing launch title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and the recently </br> released Fire Emblem: Three Houses running for two hours in portable mode, with 60% of the battery life still remaining. </p>

		<p style = "text-decoration: none; color: white "> Kevin Kenson, a YouTube creator, had previously confirmed that the new Switch model also has an updated screen model number, </br> which would explain why his tests revealed that the screen is both brighter and closer to true white balance in tone.</br> This also fitS Sharp's announcement that its IGZO display would be used by Nintendo's consoles in the future. </p>
`		<p style = "text-decoration: none; color: white"> But wait. Thereâ€™s more. the updated Switch model's Tegra X1 processor also runs cooler, which in turn keeps your Switch </br> from heating up as much. </p>
		<p style = "text-decoration: none; color: white"> If you have one of the older Switch models and don't want to purchase the new one from either Amazon or Best Buy, GameStop stores </br> are currently running an offer where you can trade in the launch model for $225, up from the usual $200, as part of a limited-time deal. </br> This brings the $300 Switch revision to $75, netting you a tasty saving. This offer is valid until September 15 only. </p>
		<p style = "text-decoration: none; color: white"> If you'd rather trade in your old launch model for the upcoming Switch Lite, you can use your $225 trade credit towards a pre-order </br> for that instead. The Switch Lite costs $200 and releases on September 20, five days after this trade-in promotion ends </br>so bear with living without your precious switch for a few days. </p>
